## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to introduce you to managed database services in Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You will learn how to start, stop, and monitor database-related services, including BigQuery and MySQL.

## Fake dataset to use: 

- data set url: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hantswilliams/HHA-504-2024/refs/heads/main/other/module8/module8_nosql_hw.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hantswilliams/HHA-504-2024/refs/heads/main/other/module8/module8_nosql_hw.csv)

### 4. Describe Your Experience

  All three platforms were fairly easy to work with. With BigQuery, I felt like I was interacting with only one interface. Loading the data and running the queries was super easy. With MongoDB and Redis, I had to create the database and take into account various connection requirements. While MongoDB just required to copy the URL with a single line of code, Redis required the portnumber, host, etc. separately. I installed the appropriate packages and I was able to connect to MongoDB and Redis. I installed MongoDB compass and ran simple query there. I added the dataset to Redis using Python and made some updates there.
